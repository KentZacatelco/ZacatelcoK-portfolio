            <p>
                I'm in this page explaining about the use of Html coding and CSS.<br /> Html code is used to make webpages like the one you're looking at.<br />
                CSS short for cascading style sheet which is also used to make <br /> this page but diffrently. Html code is mostly used to program the<br />
                webpages and used to create links to other pages and sometimes video.<br /> CSS or cascading style sheet is used to help adjust the fancy part<br />
                like the background colors and the word colors.
